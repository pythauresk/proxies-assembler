# proxies-assembler
python script (for the moment) to assemble custom proxies of MtG cards with separations between them 
(easier to cut than just merge images)

**HOW TO USE :** \
add 744x1039 pngs (up to 9) in images folder and run `main.py` to obtain `result.png`

Then you can add this image on a blank A4 paper in GIMP and create a .pdf  (had this functionality)

_______________________________

*functionalities to add*
- clear `/images` folder
- change name of result
- better interface (very very very improvable), make it as an .exe
- option to add same images without renaming


*functionalities to add later*
- assemble an image on an A4 blankpaper to give the result in .pdf

*config and tests*
- add config informations 
- add tests
