# proxies-assembler
python script (for the moment) to assemble custom proxies of MtG cards with separations between them 
(easier to cut than just merge images)

**HOW TO USE :** \
add 744x1039 pngs (up to 9) in images folder and run `main.py` to obtain `result.png`

Then you can add this image on a blank A4 paper in GIMP and create a .pdf
